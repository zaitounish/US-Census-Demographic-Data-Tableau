# US Census Demographic Data
## Tableau Visualization Project
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the census data for all counties in 2015.<br>
I have visualized this dataset using tableau and I made 1 story and 2 dashboards.<br>
I wrote for every visualization summary and the reason that we chose this specific design feel free to check them out and read further info in the pdf file.<br>
